Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data 
just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, 
as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, 
so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data 
for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. 
As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, 
so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, 
and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. 
You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. 
If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.


Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 
If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (business_id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id) FOREIGN
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id) FOREIGN
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id) FOREIGN
v. Review = 10000(id); 8090 (business_id)FOREIGN; 9581 (user_id) FOREIGN
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id) FOREIGN
vii. Photo = 10000 (id); 6493 (business_id) FOREIGN
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id); 3979 (business_id) FOREIGN
ix. User = 10000(id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)FOREIGN ;9415 (friend_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id) FOREIGN

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
	Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	-- I choose Toronto for the city and Restaurant for the category --
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	ANSWER:
	Yes. All of the businesses with 2-3 stars open before 12.00 while most of the businesses with 4-5 stars open after 12.00.
	Also, only around 10% of businesses with 2-3 that are close after 00.00 while 37% businesses with 4-5 stars close after 00.00

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Yes. Businesses with 4-5 stars have more review count than 2-3 stars. The average review count of 4-5 stars businesses is 
	41.2 while 2-3 only 28.7%

	+-------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	Since all the latitude and longitude of both groups similar, I can't infer any significant information 
	rather than all the businesses are located around the same neighborhood.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset 
and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses 
to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, 
and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. 
Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   Text analysis on photo caption based on each star ratings 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
	Type of data I will need is text data from caption in the photo table. I choose that data because I want 
	to know the context of each captions on photos, does it correlate with the star ratings. Can we predict 
	specific word in caption based on the given ratings?
